    <h3>My Background</h3>
      <div class="well well-sm">

      <p>Your unique interest in my traits in addition to my resume confirm we are going to be a solid match.  My resume in basic form, laying on a desk, doesn't tell you the unique methods by which I've been brought onto teams and into organizations. You would never know I've overhauled complete live production (audio, video and lighting) systems on my own while problem solving with technical gurus and doing loads of self-teaching; mentored many individuals throughout the organization towards more effective practices and self-awareness that in turn serve the greater whole; meanwhile leading and developing teams to assist as we creatively deliver productions and products. I can't wait to take you outside of my resume and into the person behind the paper.<br>
      

    <br>      
      For the past 8 years I have been employed in the church arena. This environment has taught me a lot. Behind the simplistic job title like "Youth Pastor" (4 years) or "Production Director" (past 4 years), was the "real work" of then creatively developing programs and crafting messages, technically speaking -creating and crafting an experience that communicated such messages, all while mentoring teams of volunteers and co-workers to feel valued and up-to-date with the most relevant training possible. I have handled my fair share of organizational crisis; not to highlight the negative but in the last five years I've assisted in leading two organizations through some difficult times as we've responded to the sudden resignation of leaders and the unexpected death of my most current manager. My ability to rise to the occasion and assist in the leadership roles of managing an organization have given me a drive to lead with excellence. I've always read and followed great leaders like Michael Hyatt, Inc. Magazine, FastCompany.com, 37Signals, "reWork" by Jason Fried, and Steve Jobs to name a few.</p>

<h3>My Motivation</h3>
  <div class="well well-sm">
      <p>
My wife is an educator. In their academia world they focus a lot on filling in the "gaps." For lack of a better term, I too have found my personality leaning in this gap-filling role direction. In school, gaps refer to those empty crevacies that were over-looked or never quite structurally sound in the mind and curriculum being taught to children. In my life I like to see gaps as opportunities. I enjoy the thrill of pursuing the problem solving process. It usually begins with a person, sometimes frustrated and aware and other times simply wishing/needing something they cannot make happen. From the dialogue during an initial needs-assesment to the construction and implementation of a plan, I love gap-filling.  But from my paper resume - you'd never know this was the role I routinely filled in the organizations I have served. In addition to filling this role for my co-workers and volunteers, I've been fueled by this opportunity as a mentor to several and have even been a part of two small-buisness start-ups as a result of my passion for the gaps. There is a sense of pride in filling a need that motivates me to be a top performer. <br>

<h3>My Role Model</h3>
  <div class="well well-sm">
      <p>
My uncle, who is a self-made millionaire. His story is truly a rags to riches story that inspires everyone who gets a chance to hear it. As my mom describes his start; “He had to get a suit from the local Goodwill store just to have something nice for my wedding." By the time he was in his 40's he was owner and leader of a multi-million dollar company with 100’s of employees. Now, in his 60's he's still learning and striving to find new ways to fill a gap and/or solve a market need. His drive to be a top performer combined with impeccable humility and integrity is inspiring. <br>

<h3>My Ideal Career Role</h3>
  <div class="well well-sm">
      <p>
My ideal career role is one in which I have a great deal of people interaction. I thrive in an environment where thinking and planning is collaborative. I love leading teams and mentoring others in their roles. Motivated by an organization mission and goal, I enjoy perfecting the "customer" experience while far exceeding the pre-determined goals set by clients and supervisors. I believe a healthy company exists where objectives are clear, employees are empowered and equipped, and trust paired with accountability rules. <br>

<h3>My Value Proposition</h3>
  <div class="well well-sm">
      <p>
My resume speaks to many of the technical skills that I have developed over the past decade, and while that is important for completing daily tasks; I believe I have a very unique value due to my vast experience in leading and developing volunteers teams.

I have been leading and developing teams of volunteers for over 8 years. All of the volunteer positions have weekly responsibilities to show up and be prepared to play crucial roles each week. The pressure of every 7 days and 52 weeks per year to have competent and quality volunteers, will make or break a person’s ability to lead. That’s exactly where I have come from and have been highly successful in recruiting, developing, and maintaining teams of volunteers that are excellent in their roles. I would argue that leading and recruiting volunteers to fill positions that are required for the organizations success is a combination of art and science. Nothing teaches leadership better than the pressure of depending on a group of volunteers to show up and preform. 

Leading volunteers can be tricky, they are both the client I serve and are fulfilling a role or job that I am the manager of.  Simply put, they are both the client and the employee, so early on in my work as a volunteer manager, I had to learn how to navigate the delicate role of holding someone to a high standard of excellence while serving them well as the client.

I believe the value of leading these types comes in the moments when the need arises to interface with the client, communicate to the Gartner team as well as the client, and problem solve with both the client and Gartner team at the same time. Leading volunteer teams requires a strategic approach to communication and a clear understanding of what is being asked of them. I will bring to the table a decade of communicating both verbal and written, as well as, a developed strategy for communicating vision, purpose, and values.
