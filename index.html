<!--   <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3> -->

    <h3>My Background:</h3>
      <p>
Your unique interest in my traits in addition to my resume confirm we are going to be a solid match.  My resume in basic form, laying on a desk, doesn't tell you the unique methods by which I've been brought onto teams and into organizations. You’d never know I’ve overhauled complete building systems on my own while problem solving with technical gurus and doing loads of self-teaching; mentored many individuals throughout the organization towards more effective practices and self-awareness that in turn serve the greater whole; meanwhile leading and developing teams to assist as we creatively deliver productions/products. I can't wait to take you outside of my resume and into the person behind the paper.<br>

<br>      
For the past 8 years I have been employed in the church arena. This environment has taught me a lot. Behind the simplistic job title like “Youth Pastor” (4 years) or “Production Director” (past 4 years), was the “real work” of then creatively developing programs and crafting messages, technically speaking -manufacturing an experience that communicated such messages, all while mentoring teams of volunteers and co-workers to feel valued and up-to-date with the most relevant training possible. I have handled my fair share of organizational crisis; not to highlight the negative but in the last five years I’ve assisted in leading two organizations through some difficult times as we’ve responded to the sudden resignation of leaders and the unexpected death of my most current manager. My ability to rise to the occasion and assist in the leadership roles of managing an organization have made me crave the opportunity to lead. I’ve always read and followed great leaders like Michael Hyatt, Inc. Magazine, FastCompany.com, 37Signals, reWork by Jason Fried, and Steve Jobs to name a few. My Uncle is one of those great leaders who I just so happen to have tutelage access to.</p>
<br>
<h3>My Motivation:</h3>
      <p>
My wife is an educator. In their academia world they focus a lot on filling in the “gaps.” For lack of a better term, I too have found my personality leaning in this gap-filling role direction. In school, gaps refer to those empty crevacies that were over-looked or never quite structurally sound in the mind and curriculum being taught to children. In my life I like to see gaps as opportunities. I enjoy the thrill of pursuing the problem solving process. It usually begins with a person, sometimes frustrated and aware and other times simply wishing/needing something they cannot make happen. From the dialogue during an initial needs-assesment to the construction and implementation of a plan, I love gap-filling.  But from my paper resume - you’d never know this was the role I routinely filled in the organizations I have served. In addition to filling this role for my co-workers and volunteers, I’ve been fueled by this opportunity as a mentor to several and have even been a part of two small-buisness start-ups as a result of my passion for the gaps. There is a sense of pride in filling a need that motivates me to be a top performer. <br>

</p>
<br>
<h3>My Role Model:</h3>
      <p>
My uncle, who is a self-made millionaire. His story is truly a rags to riches story that inspires everyone who gets a chance to hear it. As my mom describes his start; “He had to get a suit from the local Goodwill store just to have something nice for my wedding.” By the time he was in his 40’s he was owner and leader of a multi-million dollar company with 100’s of employees. Now, in his 60’s he is still learning and striving to find new ways to fill a gap or solve market need. His drive to be a top performer combined with humility and integrity is inspiring. <br>

</p>

<br>
<h3>My Ideal Career Role:</h3>
      <p>
My ideal career role is one in which I have a great deal of people interaction. I thrive in an environment where thinking and planning is collaborative. I love leading teams and mentoring others in their roles. Motivated by an organization mission and goal, I enjoy perfecting the “customer” experience while far exceeding the pre-determined goals set by my supervisors. I believe a healthy company exists where objectives are clear, employees are empowered and equipped, and trust paired with accountability rules. <br>

</p>

<br>
<h3>My Value:</h3>
      <p>
If your disappointed by my initial answer to this question, take heart and keep reading. I’m not sure my personal value proposition is unique at all. There are many values I believe to be timeless and universal. The weight however that they carry in my life and the attention to which I give them, I assure you is where-within the uniqueness lies. Big or small, significant or simple, my commitment and consistency in all circumstances to preserve my personal values is steadfast.  <br>
